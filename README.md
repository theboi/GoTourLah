## About

Accomplishment: *1st place* in ChangeMakers InnoFest Challenge 2020

Disclaimer: This app is part of a **prototype** for a make-a-thon and is not fully functional.

An app to allow users to tour Singapore in a revolutionary manner, through various AR challenges and tours. This app was created as a part of a final product in the ChangeMakers InnoFest Challenge by my group, Parliament.

The ChangeMakers InnoFest Challenge 2020 is a make-a-thon competiton for Secondary 2 students in the School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST). It aims "to seed and nurture a maker and innovative culture in SST, in line with the schoolâ€™s **mission of *nurturing passionate innovators who improve society through real-world applications of science and technology***."

Students will be more "able to appreciate, understand and apply the content and skills acquired in the ChangeMakers' programme, through the creation and presentation of their proposed solutions to the given challenge."

Main Theme: **REThinking the 'new normal' in a post-COVID world**
Sub Themes:
- Public Transportation System
- **Tourism Spots/Places of Interest** (my team's topic)
- Sports & Wellness
- Rethinking spaces and buildings
